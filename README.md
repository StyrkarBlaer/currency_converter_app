# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was initialized with the create react app and allows for all the commands that follow with it.  

My hope is that this will be a project with a fully functional front end and back end that allow the user to convert any  currenct to any other currency (and maybe crypto) seamlessly.  

This project runs on React/Typescript.
